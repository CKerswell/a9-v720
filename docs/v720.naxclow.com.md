# Server side 

## Server side 

1. First device goes to register on `bootstrap` server which gives to camera new name and after point on dedicated server with which it will works

```log
curl -v -X POST "http://v720.naxclow.com/app/api/ApiSysDevicesBatch/registerDevices?batch=A9_X4_V12&random=DEFGHI&token=547d4ef98b"
*   Trying 120.79.92.139:80...
* Connected to v720.naxclow.com (120.79.92.139) port 80 (#0)
> POST /app/api/ApiSysDevicesBatch/registerDevices?batch=A9_X4_V12&random=DEFGHI&token=547d4ef98b HTTP/1.1
> Host: v720.naxclow.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.74.0

{"code":200,"message":"操作成功","data":"0800c00128F8"} 
```

After that device AP will have name `0800c00128F8`. `操作成功` - translates as 'OK'. This will happens only once, after this step camera will never do this again.


2. Device try to get dedicated server info. So let's route them to our IP (10.42.0.1)

```log
curl -v -X POST "http://v720.naxclow.com/app/api/ApiServer/getA9ConfCheck?devicesCode=0800c00128F8&random=FGHIJK&token=68778db973"
